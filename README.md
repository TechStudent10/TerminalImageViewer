# TerminalImageViewer
An image viewer in the terminal using Python

## Setup

Python 3.8+ is required

1. Install the required dependencies
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the file with an image
```bash
$ python main.py <image>
```

<!-- ## How?
Using the Pillow (PIL) library, I was able to parse over every single pixel in the image. I looped over the image, and within every loop, I looked over the RGBA value of the pixel somewhat accurately to get the image text. -->
